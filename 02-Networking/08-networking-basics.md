# 🌐 Networking Fundamentals – Part 1

## Networking Basics & OSI Model

---

## 1. What is a Network?

A network is a group of connected devices that communicate to share data and resources.

Networking is the foundation of cybersecurity because attacks occur over networks.

---

## 2. Importance of Networking in Cybersecurity

- Enables data communication
- Exposes attack surfaces
- Allows attackers to exploit protocols
- Helps defenders monitor traffic

Every cyberattack involves network communication.

---

## 3. Types of Networks

### LAN

- Local Area Network
- Small geographic area
- High speed

### WAN

- Wide Area Network
- Covers large areas
- Internet is a WAN

---

## 4. Network Components

### IP Address

Unique identifier for a device on a network.
Example:

192.168.1.1

### Port

Identifies a service running on a device.
Common ports:

- 80 → HTTP
- 443 → HTTPS
- 22 → SSH

---

## 5. Protocols

Protocols define how data is transmitted and received.

Examples:

- HTTP
- FTP
- SMTP

---

## 6. OSI Model

The OSI model explains how data travels through a network using seven layers.

Mnemonic:
All People Seem To Need Data Processing

---

## 7. OSI Layers

7. Application – User-facing services (HTTP, FTP)
8. Presentation – Encryption, formatting
9. Session – Session management
10. Transport – TCP/UDP, ports
11. Network – IP addressing, routing
12. Data Link – MAC addresses
13. Physical – Hardware and signals

---

## 8. Security Relevance of OSI Model

Each OSI layer can be targeted by attacks:

- Application → SQL Injection
- Transport → Port scanning
- Network → IP spoofing
- Data Link → ARP poisoning

---

## Key Takeaway

Understanding networking and the OSI model is essential for identifying, exploiting, and defending against cyberattacks.
